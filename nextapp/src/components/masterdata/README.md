# Masterdata Components

The components are templates for the website. The objects are created with a different script and include the components according to the masterdata. Every template should show every possibility (e.g. mandatory, empty, description long or short, ...).

Some component properties are general, others are specific. To gather information about the general and specific properties, this document collects information.

Another thing to keep in mind is width of each item. The old GUI showed every property on full side width, which is wasteful for small properties. But the width of each property can depend on the input text and / or labels / descriptions.

## General Properties

- Code: unique code for property
- Name: visible short name
- Description: Longer (max. 2000 characters) description
- Mandatory: property is required if new object is created
- Editable: property not editable by user in web (but with other API)

### Multiline Varchar

### Object

### Real

### Timestamp
