# NextLaBIS

NextLaBIS is a modern web app built with Next.js, integrating OpenBIS for electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and LIMS. It allows users to manage projects, visualise hierarchical data, and use customisable object templates, streamlining scientific workflows and data management.

The aim is to create a new web UI for the electronic lab notebook software OpenBIS. The current UI is outdated, slow, inefficient, not responsive, painful to customise, and lacks overall intuition. This project attempts to correct these mistakes and make OpenBIS more attractive to new researchers.

I am not a professional developer. I donâ€™t have years of programming experience, nor do I have the ability to create a good program by myself. However, I have two years of experience in OpenBIS and GitHub Copilot and the ability to understand new things with enough time and dedication. I am thankful for any help, tips, or other contributions to this project. My goal is to create a good project to present to the OpenBIS development team with the intention of implementing or showing it officially.
